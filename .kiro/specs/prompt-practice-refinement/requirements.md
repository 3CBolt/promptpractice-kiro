# Requirements Document - Prompt Practice App Refinement Phase

## Introduction

The Prompt Practice App MVP is functionally complete but needs refinement to provide a polished, beginner-friendly learning experience. Users currently face unclear onboarding, opaque feedback, and missing progression indicators. This refinement phase addresses UX gaps, engineering improvements, and accessibility requirements to create a cohesive educational platform.
