# System Prompts and Role Setting

System prompts are special instructions that set the AI's role, personality, and behavior before the main conversation begins. Think of them as giving the AI a job description and personality guide that influences how it responds to all subsequent messages.

## What are System Prompts?

A system prompt is typically the first message in a conversation that establishes:
- The AI's role or persona
- Its expertise and knowledge focus
- The tone and style it should use
- Any specific rules or constraints
- The context for the interaction

## Why Use System Prompts?

System prompts help you:
- Get more consistent responses
- Access specialized knowledge or perspectives
- Control the AI's communication style
- Set boundaries and expectations
- Create more engaging interactions

## Basic Role Setting

The simplest system prompts assign a clear role to the AI.

üìù **Example - Basic Role:**

**System Prompt:** "You are a helpful math tutor who explains concepts clearly and encourages students."

**User Message:** "I don't understand fractions."

**Result:** The AI will respond as a patient, encouraging tutor rather than just providing information.

## Advanced Persona Techniques

### 1. Detailed Professional Roles

Create rich, specific personas with expertise and personality.

üìù **Example - Professional Persona:**

**System Prompt:** "You are Dr. Sarah Chen, a marine biologist with 15 years of experience studying coral reefs. You're passionate about ocean conservation and have a talent for explaining complex scientific concepts in accessible ways. You often use analogies and real-world examples from your fieldwork. You're optimistic but realistic about environmental challenges."

**Why it works:** Specific expertise, personality traits, communication style, and perspective are all defined.

### 2. Context-Aware Assistants

Set up the AI to understand specific situations or environments.

üìù **Example - Context-Aware:**

**System Prompt:** "You are an experienced project manager helping a small startup team. The team is working on their first mobile app launch with limited budget and tight deadlines. You understand the challenges of resource constraints and provide practical, actionable advice. You're supportive but realistic about what can be achieved."

### 3. Style and Tone Control

Use system prompts to control how the AI communicates.

üìù **Example - Communication Style:**

**System Prompt:** "You are a friendly, conversational writing coach. You give feedback in a supportive, encouraging way. You always start with something positive, then offer specific suggestions for improvement. You use simple language and avoid jargon. You ask questions to understand the writer's goals."

## Practical Applications

### Customer Service Representative
**System Prompt:** "You are a customer service representative for a small online bookstore. You're knowledgeable about books, shipping policies, and returns. You're patient, helpful, and always try to find solutions. If you can't solve a problem, you escalate it appropriately while keeping the customer informed."

### Creative Writing Partner
**System Prompt:** "You are a creative writing collaborator who helps develop stories and characters. You ask thoughtful questions to help writers explore their ideas deeper. You're encouraging and imaginative, offering suggestions while respecting the writer's vision. You're familiar with various genres and storytelling techniques."

### Technical Mentor
**System Prompt:** "You are a senior software developer mentoring a junior programmer. You explain concepts clearly, provide code examples, and suggest best practices. You're patient with questions and always explain the 'why' behind your recommendations. You encourage good coding habits and help troubleshoot problems systematically."

## Before and After Examples

### Example 1: Learning Assistant

**Before (No System Prompt):**
"Explain photosynthesis."

**After (With System Prompt):**
**System:** "You are an enthusiastic high school biology teacher who loves making science accessible and exciting. You use analogies, ask engaging questions, and connect concepts to everyday life."
**User:** "Explain photosynthesis."

**Result:** Instead of a dry scientific explanation, you get an engaging lesson with analogies (like plants being solar-powered food factories) and connections to daily life.

### Example 2: Problem Solving

**Before (No System Prompt):**
"My team isn't communicating well."

**After (With System Prompt):**
**System:** "You are an experienced team coach who specializes in improving workplace communication. You ask probing questions to understand the root causes and provide practical, actionable solutions. You're empathetic but focused on results."
**User:** "My team isn't communicating well."

**Result:** The AI will ask specific questions about team dynamics, communication patterns, and goals before offering targeted solutions.

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Multi-Perspective Roles

Create system prompts that incorporate multiple viewpoints.

üìù **Example - Multi-Perspective:**

**System Prompt:** "You are a business consultant who analyzes decisions from three perspectives: financial impact, employee satisfaction, and long-term sustainability. You always consider all three angles before making recommendations and explain the trade-offs between them."

### 2. Constraint-Based Roles

Use system prompts to set specific limitations or requirements.

üìù **Example - Constraints:**

**System Prompt:** "You are a fitness coach who creates workout plans for people with limited time and equipment. You never recommend exercises that require more than 30 minutes or equipment beyond basic items found at home. You focus on efficiency and safety."

### 3. Dynamic Context Roles

Create roles that adapt based on the user's needs.

üìù **Example - Adaptive Role:**

**System Prompt:** "You are a learning assistant who adapts your teaching style based on the user's experience level. For beginners, you use simple language and lots of examples. For advanced users, you can use technical terms and focus on nuanced concepts. Always assess the user's level before diving deep into explanations."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Being Too Vague
**Problem:** "You are helpful."
**Solution:** "You are a patient coding mentor who explains programming concepts step-by-step, provides working examples, and helps debug issues."

### 2. Conflicting Instructions
**Problem:** "You are both a strict teacher and a casual friend."
**Solution:** Choose one consistent persona or clearly define when to switch between modes.

### 3. Overcomplicating the Role
**Problem:** A paragraph-long system prompt with too many details
**Solution:** Focus on 3-4 key characteristics that will most impact the interaction.

### 4. Forgetting the User's Perspective
**Problem:** "You are an expert who knows everything."
**Solution:** "You are an expert who remembers what it's like to be a beginner and explains things clearly."

## Tips for Effective System Prompts

üí° **Tip 1:** Start with the role, then add personality and communication style: "You are a [role] who [personality traits] and [communication style]."

üí° **Tip 2:** Include the AI's attitude toward the user: "You're supportive," "You're challenging but fair," "You're patient with questions."

üí° **Tip 3:** Set clear boundaries: "If you don't know something, say so," "Always ask for clarification when requests are unclear."

üí° **Tip 4:** Test your system prompt with different types of questions to ensure consistency.
