# Prompt Fundamentals

Welcome to the world of prompt engineering! This guide covers the essential concepts you need to understand to write effective prompts for AI language models.

## What is a Prompt?

A prompt is the input text you provide to an AI language model to get a desired response. Think of it as giving instructions or asking questions to guide the AI's output.

## Key Principles

### 1. Be Specific and Clear
- Use precise language
- Avoid ambiguous terms
- Provide context when needed

### 2. Structure Your Requests
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Use formatting to organize information
- Include examples when helpful

### 3. Set Expectations
- Specify the desired format
- Indicate the level of detail needed
- Mention any constraints or requirements

## Basic Examples

**Simple Question:**
```
What is the capital of France?
```

**Structured Request:**

1. Definition
2. Main causes
3. Key impacts
4. Potential solutions
```
