# Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

Welcome to the world of prompt engineering! This guide covers the essential concepts you need to understand to write effective prompts for AI language models.

## What is a Prompt?

A prompt is the input text you provide to an AI language model to get a desired response. Think of it as giving instructions or asking questions to guide the AI's output. The quality of your prompt directly affects the quality of the AI's response.

## Core Principles

### 1. Be Specific and Clear

Vague prompts lead to vague responses. The more specific you are, the better the AI can understand what you want.

üìù **Example - Vague vs. Specific:**

**Vague:** "Tell me about dogs."
**Specific:** "Explain the key differences between Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds in terms of temperament, exercise needs, and grooming requirements."

üí° **Tip:** If you wouldn't know how to answer your own prompt clearly, the AI probably won't either.

### 2. Provide Context and Background

Give the AI enough information to understand the situation and respond appropriately.

üìù **Example - Adding Context:**

**Without context:** "How should I handle this situation?"
**With context:** "I'm a new manager and one of my team members consistently misses deadlines. I want to address this constructively without damaging our working relationship. How should I handle this situation?"

### 3. Structure Your Requests

Well-organized prompts help the AI organize its responses. Use formatting, bullet points, and clear sections.

üìù **Example - Structured Request:**

```
Please analyze the following business idea and provide feedback in this format:

Business Idea: A mobile app that helps people find local hiking trails

Analysis needed:
1. Market potential (1-2 sentences)
2. Main competitors (list 2-3)
3. Biggest challenges (list 3)
4. Success factors (list 3)
```

### 4. Set Clear Expectations

Tell the AI exactly what format, length, and style you want.

üìù **Example - Setting Expectations:**

"Write a professional email to a client explaining a project delay. Keep it under 150 words, maintain a positive tone, and include a revised timeline."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Being Too Broad
**Problem:** "Explain marketing"
**Solution:** "Explain the difference between digital marketing and traditional marketing for small businesses"

### 2. Assuming Knowledge
**Problem:** "Fix the bug in my code" (without showing the code)
**Solution:** "Here's my Python function [code]. It should calculate the average but returns an error. Can you identify and fix the issue?"

### 3. Multiple Unrelated Questions
**Problem:** "What's the weather like and how do I bake a cake and what's the stock market doing?"
**Solution:** Ask one focused question at a time, or clearly separate different topics

### 4. Forgetting to Specify Format
**Problem:** "List the benefits of exercise"
**Solution:** "List 5 key benefits of regular exercise, with each benefit explained in 1-2 sentences"

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Research Assistant
**Prompt:** "I'm writing a blog post about remote work productivity. Please provide 5 evidence-based tips for staying productive while working from home. For each tip, include a brief explanation of why it works and a practical implementation suggestion."

**Why it works:** Specific topic, clear number requested, asks for evidence-based information, requests both explanation and practical advice.

### Example 2: Creative Writing Helper
**Prompt:** "Help me brainstorm character names for a fantasy novel. I need 3 names each for: brave knights, wise wizards, and cunning thieves. Each name should sound medieval European and include a brief description of what makes it fitting for that character type."

**Why it works:** Clear categories, specific number, style guidance, asks for reasoning behind suggestions.

### Example 3: Problem Solving
**Prompt:** "I have a small garden (10x8 feet) with partial shade (4-5 hours of morning sun). I want to grow vegetables that my family will actually eat - we like tomatoes, lettuce, herbs, and peppers. What vegetables should I plant and how should I arrange them for the best results?"

**Why it works:** Provides specific constraints (size, light conditions), states preferences, asks for both selection and arrangement advice.

## Try This in a Lab

Ready to practice? Head to our [Practice Lab](/labs/practice-basics) and try these starter prompts:

**Beginner:** "Explain the water cycle in simple terms for a 10-year-old, using an analogy they can relate to."

**Intermediate:** "I'm planning a 3-day weekend trip to a city I've never visited. Create a balanced itinerary that includes cultural attractions, local food experiences, and outdoor activities. Assume a moderate budget and that I enjoy both history and nature."

**Advanced:** "Analyze this product description and rewrite it to be more compelling for online sales. Focus on benefits over features and include a clear call-to-action. Original: 'Our vacuum cleaner has a 1200W motor, HEPA filter, and 5-meter cord.'"
